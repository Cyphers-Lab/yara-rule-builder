# YARA Rule Builder

A modern web application that simplifies the creation of YARA rules through an intuitive graphical interface. Built with React and TypeScript, this tool helps malware researchers and security professionals create, preview, and export YARA rules efficiently.

## What is YARA?

YARA is a powerful tool designed to help malware researchers identify and classify malware samples. Created by Victor M. Alvarez while working at VirusTotal, YARA provides a way to create descriptions of malware families based on textual or binary patterns.

Think of YARA rules as the malware researcher's Swiss Army knife - they allow you to create complex patterns to match against files, making it possible to identify specific malware families or detect certain suspicious patterns across files.
